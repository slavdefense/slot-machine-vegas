<h3>Introduction</h3>

'Rock the slot' is a slot machine game that randomly generates emoji symbols on a click of a button. There are 3 screens that spins symbols and when the spin stops, emojis are lined up horizontally. To win, all displayed emojis has to match each other exactly.
A player can withdraw the game anytime by pressing the withdraw button. There is no money involved in this game and will never be. This is a project I completed to depict my understanding of Javascript control flow with sequence, brancing and looping.

<h3>Credit</h3>
I do not own the clip of the song "Ace of Spades" by Motorhead, which is played when the slot draws a jackpot combination. All credit goes to Motorhead and rest in peace the lead vocalist and guitarist mighty Lemmy Kilmister. You are missed!
The song was choosen because it is relavant to this game and is distributed without profit to those who expresses a prior interest in receiving the included information for research and educational purposes.
